# FSY Check In

Please read my docs here: (https://wiki.codyhowell.dev/fsycheckin)[https://wiki.codyhowell.dev/fsycheckin]

This uses a fully local-hosted Docker setup for database, API, and frontend. It's a seasonal app that enables you 
to check in people. It's designed for multiple apartment complexes, where the users of the app have to hand out the 
keys to those people. There are a few features that attempt to make that quick. 

For the admins, you can upload files for import and download CSV reports of each week. For security, you can download the 
logs that were generated to help validate the information in the original CSV.
